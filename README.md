## What is pypak?
pypak is a commandline tool that packs a python project into a single file using Python's pyz files. It also automatically self-updates to ensure that it is using the latest version no matter how you have set it up.

## Installation
Just downliad the file from the releases page, and drop it in the root of your project.

## Usage
Just run `python3 ./pypak ./path/to/project` and it will try to compress your project for you.
